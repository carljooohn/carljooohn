## About Me
- I enjoy building **AI-assisted applications**, especially chatbots with memory, databases, and system-level logic.
- Built a **local AI chatbot** using **Python, Flask, and web technologies**, [view project](https://github.com/Pranziss/Simple--Lightweight-Chatbot).
- Also built **Nova Learning Center**, a GUI mini learning system focused on quizzes and user management. [view project](https://github.com/Pranziss/Nova-Learning-GUI).
- Currently working on **ScholarLite**, a deployable academic assistant web app, database-backed storage, and clean APIs for future LLM integration and **NovaDC-bot / AvonDC-bot**, an experimental AI Discord bot. (**in progress**).
- Actively improving my understanding of **databases, backend systems, AI integration, and software fundamentals**.
